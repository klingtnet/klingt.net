I'm **Andreas Linz**.

I love to develop software, at the moment especially with
[python](https://www.python.org/). Besides I enjoy to learn for my
masters degree in computer science at the [University
Leipzig](http://www.zv.uni-leipzig.de/) and write code for
[spreadshirt](http://www.spreadshirt.com/).

Contact
=======

The easiest way to get in touch with me is to send me an email:

``` {.sourceCode .}
ten.tgnilk@znila
```

Interests
=========

I've a very broad field of interests, with a priority on everything
audio related. The whole process from creating music to the physical
playback by the loudspeaker always fascinated me. That's why I built my
own speakers and sometimes twiddling knobs to make some pleasant sound
textures. An [arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) based
midi-controller—that wasn't finished because I never built a case for
this thing—was also one of my past projects. Of course I also love
listening to music from all kinds of genres.

Of course I am fascinated and interested in computer science topics.

Sometimes, when I have the time and muse, I also draw logos or
illustrations, too. Lately this isn't so often the case, because there
is also a life w/o technology and I discovered
[Netflix](http://netflix.com/).

Technologies
============

-   [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), mainly because I really
    like the rolling-release model and that you get a vanilla system,
    unlike all those proprietary modifications that you have on
    [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) for example
-   [zsh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell)
-   [python](https://www.python.org/), only python3 and pypy
-   javascript, if you make anything web-related then you won't come
    around using this mess (waiting for
    [ecmascript6](http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts))
-   [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/index.html), almost never use it
    for private projects
-   C/C++, i have to hone my low-level skills because python in
    combination with C or C++ is almighty ;)
-   apropos low-level, I'm learning
    [Rust](https://github.com/klingtnet/rust-guide-examples) and hope to
    do some audio related stuff with it in the near future
-   [Go](http://golang.org/), one of my future goals is to [get started
    with Go](https://github.com/klingtnet/get-go-ing)
-   [\[Xe\]TeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XeTeX) it's a must for
    academic work and also a hassle, the idea of separating format and
    content does'nt work at all in any TeX variant if we are honest
-   a whole lot of other stuff...

Why klingt.net?
===============

The domain name was an idea of a good friend of mine. The name should
have something to do with audio or music, because this was the main
topic which I wanted to write about in 2006, when I registered this
domain. It's a word play of the german sentence *Das klingt nett*, what
means *That sounds nice*.
