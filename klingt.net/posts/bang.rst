.. description: Shortcuts for DuckDuckGo.
.. type: text

Today I stumbled across this this `article <https://duckduckgo.com/bang.html>`_ which describes how to use the so called *!Bangs*. A *!Bang* is nothing more than a shortcut for a specific websearch prefixed with an ``!``. DuckDuckGo_ has hundreds of these shortcuts integrated, take for example ``!i`` to search for images with google or ``!yt`` to search on YouTube. This is really powerful, ``!wa plot sin(x)*sin(y)`` plots a simple wave funtion using `wolframalpha <http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=plot%20sin(x)*sin(y)>`_. You don't have to know all the shortcuts because their autocompletion does that for you, like you can see in the picture below.

Now I only need to find out how I can request their webcrawler to recrawl this website, because this was what I actually would have liked to know.
