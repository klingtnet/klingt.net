-   A study from 2013 has examinded [the impact of listening to music on
    cognitive
    performance](http://www.studentpulse.com/articles/762/the-impact-of-listening-to-music-on-cognitive-performance).
    They used different musical genres as well as low and high volume
    levels and there was also a control group that has learned
    in silence. I've found this study interesting because I am very
    often listening to background music while programming, learning
    or reading. According to the results of the study, there is no
    significant difference between genres but the playback volume
    is important. The best results achieved the participants that
    studied in silence, the more the volume increases the more decreases
    the cognitive performance.
-   Because of the unique factorization property of the natural numbers
    we [can't tune
    pianos](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/2014/11/30/the-saddest-thing-i-know-about-the-integers/),
    at least we can't do it perfectly. This article fits very good to
    the last link from [last weeks list](/posts/links-for-cw48).
-   A concept for an [HTML6 specifiction](http://html6spec.com/) that
    introduces namespaces and arbitrary tag names. I would like to see
    an HTML6 that uses a [HAML](http://haml.info/) like syntax and
    enforces strictness for parses, invalid HTML should result in an
    error message.
-   The [McDonald's
    Theory](https://medium.com/@ienjoy/mcdonalds-theory-9216e1c9da7d).
-   Xiph.org's Monty [explains why 24bit/192kHz music downloads are not
    only useless but also
    problematic](http://xiph.org/~xiphmont/demo/neil-young.html). Before
    reading this article you should have watched at least his [digital
    show & tell](http://xiph.org/video/) where he cleans up with common
    misconceptions about digital audio.
-   Recently I gained a bit more interest in systems programming and one
    thing you have deal with are [Unix
    signals](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_%28Unix%29), [this
    guide](http://741mhz.com/signal-handler/) from the great 741Mhz.com
    blog shows you how to it right.
-   [Natural Language Processing using Python's
    Pandas](http://engineroom.trackmaven.com/blog/monthly-challenge-natural-language-processing/)
    with gmail as data source. I've read this because I am doing a
    project this semester which has the goal to make an authorship
    analysis on biblical texts written in old greek.
-   Some nice examples how to [visualize distributions of
    data](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/mwaskom/seaborn/blob/master/examples/plotting_distributions.ipynb)
    using [matplotib](http://matplotlib.org/) and
    [seaborn](http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) in
    Ipython notebooks.
-   [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a statically typed systems
    programming language with features like pattern matching, guaranteed
    memory safety and type inference, to name a few. The [introductary
    guide](http://doc.rust-lang.org/0.12.0/guide.html) is well written
    and extensive. The examples that I wrote while reading the guide are
    available on
    [github](https://github.com/klingtnet/rust-guide-examples).
-   Besides rust I also want to learn [golang](https://www.golang.org),
    maybe with the help of [The Little Go
    Book](https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-go-book/blob/master/en/go.md)
    by Karl Seguin. He has also written books about
    [Redis](https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-redis-book) and
    [MongoDB](https://github.com/karlseguin/the-little-mongodb-book) in
    his "little books" series.
-   The [schedule for the 31st Chaos Communication
    Congress](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/schedule.html)
    is online.
-   [Running bash commands in the background
    properly](http://felixmilea.com/2014/12/running-bash-commands-background-properly/),
    didn't know about `disown` and `nohup`.
