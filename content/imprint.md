I disagree to the usage and transmission of data used for the purpose of
advertisment- market or opinion research.

This website **doesn't** use any tracker or analysis tools like [Google
Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/), also i won't record any
logs. If you notice anything suspicious please let me know.

Note that I try to serve everything from my own server without using
CDNs. Until [KaTeX](https://github.com/Khan/KaTeX) is production ready I
have to make one exception for [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/). This
is because MathJax is quite large and performs better when using their
CDN because of caching.

My PGP public key\_, you can get it also on the [MIT
key-server](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xA57EA37073871146)
`gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu/ --recv-keys 0x9AA3F5EC`{.sourceCode}.

[^1]: I've done in the hope to prevent misuse of address by stupid spam
    bots. At first I had implemented a solution with simple encryption
    and a captcha, but this involved javascript, which is -- sadly --
    not everywhere available.
