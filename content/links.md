- [The Java Memory Model](http://shipilev.net/blog/2016/close-encounters-of-jmm-kind/) I'm a little bit astound over the amount of things to know about the JMM. My expectation was that this would fit on a beer mat.

- [what every programmer should know about memory](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf). This article (or short book) is well written and refreshes or explains a lot of concepts that are worth to know about computer memory. This is *not* solely written for system programmers!

- [hifi-forum.de](http://www.hifi-forum.de/viewforum-104.html) Here meets the german DIY loudspeaker community. The [DIY speaker gallery](http://www.hifi-forum.de/viewthread-104-15079-186.html) is always worth a look
- [diyaudio.com](http://www.diyaudio.com/) Maybe the largest online resource for DIY audio enthusiasts (except software)
