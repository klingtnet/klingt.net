## Articles

- [what is CS?](https://www.cs.mtu.edu/~john/whatiscs.html) What is computer science?
- [what every CS major should know](http://matt.might.net/articles/what-cs-majors-should-know/) At least what the author thinks what everyone should know. Nonetheless, an interesting list of links and topics
- [A list of awesome lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

## PDFs

- [What every programmer should know about floating point](https://www.ualberta.ca/~kbeach/phys420_580_2010/docs/ACM-Goldberg.pdf) Never heard of IEEE754 or didn't know what a mantissa is? Read this!
- [what every programmer should know about memory](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf). This article (or short book) is well written and refreshes or explains a lot of concepts that are worth to know about computer memory. This is *not* solely written for system programmers!

## Math

- [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/) A graphical online calculator. Regarding this as calculator is a bit too much understatement. This is really great to make interactive function plots
- [wolframalpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/) The online version of Wolfram Mathematica, a *computational knowledge engine* (did someone say singularity?)

- [hifi-forum.de](http://www.hifi-forum.de/viewforum-104.html) Here meets the german DIY loudspeaker community. The [DIY speaker gallery](http://www.hifi-forum.de/viewthread-104-15079-186.html) is always worth a look
- [diyaudio.com](http://www.diyaudio.com/) Maybe the largest online resource for DIY audio enthusiasts (except software)

## Blogs

- [fefes blog](http://blog.fefe.de/?css=hukl.css) Opinions about his blog differ sharply but for me it's a quite entertaining read. This is only for people with a stable opinion and you should always double check his posts

- [createdigitalmusic](http://createdigitalmusic.com/) A blog about the latest trends and gadgets in the audio production area

- [Mad Slabs](http://spinfoam.net/madslabs.html) My alltime favorite music podcast. No comments nor moderation only 2+ hours of fresh new music. The played genres represent my own personal taste quite good because they're pretty diverse and range from ambient/drone or classical to breakcore or distorted german techno tunes.
- [the  bike shed](http://bikeshed.fm/) A podcast about development related topics.
- [methodisch inkorrekt](http://minkorrekt.de/) Two german scientists discuss current topics in science and research or talk about the daily routine in general.

## This and That
