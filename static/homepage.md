# Hello there!

I am **Andreas Linz**.

Before getting a computer scientist I have learned how to solder and measure electronic components, layout schematics, build circuit boards, and even how to operate a lathe or CNC mill.
But my real passion are computers and software.
Therefore, I decided to study computer science, got my bachelors degree in 2013 and I am currently in the last steps of finishing my masters degree at the [University of Leipzig](http://www.uni-leipzig.de/).
The thesis topic is *Programming a Realtime Remote Controllable FM Audio Synthesizer in Rust*.

As you might have already guessed, I am also passionate about audio.
I have build a pair of loudspeakers, a Midi controller and I am maintaining some audio related software projects on [github](github.com/klingtnet).

I love music and I am fascinated by the whole process of generating audio signals.
Besides I like to do systems programming and build web services.
I also have some experience with front-end technologies like CSS/SCSS or Javascript.
Sometimes I create beautiful things with [TeX](https://github.com/klingtnet/beamer_template), too.
